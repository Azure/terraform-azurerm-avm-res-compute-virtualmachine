# Simple Windows VM with load balancing and security associations

This example demonstrates the creation of a simple Windows Server 2022 VM with the following features:

    - a single private NIC with multiple IP configurations
    - a single default OS 128gb OS disk
    - a role assignment giving the deployment user Key Vault Secrets Officer permissions on the key vault
    - an autogenerated password that is stored as a secret in the key vault resource.
    - an optional bastion resource that can be deployed by uncommenting the bastion elements in the example

It includes the following resources in addition to the VM resource:

    - A vnet with three subnets 
    - A keyvault for storing the login secrets and disk encryption key
    - An optional subnet, public ip, and bastion which can be enabled by uncommenting the bastion resources when running the example.
    - An internal load-balancer with NAT rules for demonstrating load-balancer associations
    - An NSG for demonstrating NSG associations
    - An ASG for demonstrating ASG associations
    - An internal Application Gateway for demonstrating Application Gateway Backend Pool associations.
