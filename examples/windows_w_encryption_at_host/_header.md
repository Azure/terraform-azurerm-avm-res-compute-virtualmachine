# Simple Windows VM with Encryption at Host

This example demonstrates the creation of a simple Windows Server 2022 VM with the following features:

    - Disk Encryption enabled on the OS and Data Disks using a custom key using a Disk Encryption Set and a User Assigned Managed Identity
    - a single private IPv4 address 
    - a single default OS 128gb OS disk
    - an encrypted 32gb data disk
    - a role assignment giving the deployment user Key Vault Secrets Officer permissions on the key vault
    - an autogenerated password that is stored as a secret in the key vault resource.
    - an optional bastion resource that can be deployed by uncommenting the bastion elements in the example

It includes the following resources in addition to the VM resource:

    - A vnet with two subnets 
    - A keyvault for storing the login secrets and disk encryption key
    - A disk encryption set for encrypting the disks
    - A User Assigned Managed Identity for use by the disk encryption set to access the key vault
    - An optional subnet, public ip, and bastion which can be enabled by uncommenting the bastion resources when running the example.
