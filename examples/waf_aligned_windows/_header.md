# Simple Windows VM with load balancing and security associations

This example demonstrates the creation of a simple Windows Server 2022 VM that has a Well Architected Framework (WAF) configuration. This example includes external resources required to configure the WAF elements.

    - a single private NIC with multiple IP configurations
    - a single default OS 128gb OS disk
    - a role assignment giving the deployment user Key Vault Secrets Officer permissions on the key vault
    - a gallery application installing visual studio code
    - a sample maintenance schedule
    - a sample backup policy configured to do a simple backup
    - an autogenerated password that is stored as a secret in the key vault resource.
    - an optional bastion resource that can be deployed by uncommenting the bastion elements in the example

It includes the following resources in addition to the VM resource:

    - A vnet with three subnets 
    - A keyvault for storing the login secrets and disk encryption key
    - An optional subnet, public ip, and bastion which can be enabled by uncommenting the bastion resources when running the example.
    - A simple gallery application that installs visual studio code to demonstrate and test gallery application functionality.
    - A simple maintenance schedule for demonstrating the maintenance schedule interface.
    - A recovery services vault for storing backups
    - A backup policy for use demonstrating backups
