# Simple Windows VM 

This example demonstrates the creation of a simple Ubuntu VM with a single private IPv4 address and an auto-generated SSH key for an admin user named azureuser. The example creates a key vault for storage of the private key so it can be referenced when logging in with Bastion or downloaded as needed. Password authentication is disabled in this example.
