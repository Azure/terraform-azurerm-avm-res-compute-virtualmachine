# Simple Windows VM with the Azure Monitor Agent and Diagnostic Settings configured

This example demonstrates the creation of a simple Windows Server 2022 VM with the following features:

    - a single private IPv4 address 
    - a single default OS 128gb OS disk
    - an autogenerated password that is stored as a secret in the key vault resource.
    - an optional bastion resource that can be deployed by uncommenting the bastion elements in the example
    - an extension resource that installs the Azure monitor Agent
    - an extension resource to demonstrate Azure Disk Encryption

It includes the following resources in addition to the VM resource:

    - A Vnet with two subnets 
    - A keyvault for storing the login secrets
    - a log analytics workspace for the logs and metrics
    - a data collection rule configuring the vm logs and metrics to be sent to the log analytics workspace
    - An optional subnet, public ip, and bastion which can be enabled by uncommenting the bastion resources when running the example.
